# Hüseyin Gülen

Software Architect building scalable, secure and production-grade systems.

I design infrastructure.  
I build resilient platforms.  
I solve complexity.

## System Design Approach

Users --> Edge
Edge --> Gateway
Gateway --> Services
Services --> Cache
Services --> Database
Services --> AI
Database --> Replicas
Replicas --> Backup
AI --> VectorStore
```

**Principles**

```
Architecture > Code
Scalability > Speed
Security > Convenience
Reliability > Trend
```

Great systems are quiet.  
If you notice the infrastructure — it is already failing.
